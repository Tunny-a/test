refactor dry and generally improve the syntax of the to_text method now the logic is figured

do the same for the to_binary

sort to_hex so it doesnt use to_binary?

add methods to string to convert back to ints

make new classes for hex and binary?

do the memory thing at some point

put spinner in own branch? and play with git branching stuff
